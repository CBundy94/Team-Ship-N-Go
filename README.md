# Team Ship-N-GO
This repository contains team Ship-N-GO's files for implementing a mailbox rental reservation application based on rate, size, and lease term. 

To run the application, simply go to the gitHub page link:

To use the application, you can scroll down to the 3 images of the different size mailboxes we offer and click one of the black reserve buttons to enter your information to reserve. Likewise you can move your cursor around the interactive links at the top of the header for additional info and services.
